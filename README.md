# WhatsMyImage
This is a website that uses the ResNet50 Model pre-trained on ImageNet to guess whats in the image you upload.

This website was built with React, Flask, and PyTorch.

## Future Updates:
Apply Transfer learning in order to get more accurate guesses
Possibly turn model to guess images on a specific category rather than a broad amount of categories, ex: Cars or Food.

## How to run:

For frontend, open terminal and cd to the frontend folder. Run npm run dev in order to start website

For backend, create another terminal and cd to backend folder. Run python3 server.py if your on mac or py server.py on windows.
