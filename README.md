# WhatsMyImage
This is a website that uses the ResNet50 Model pre-trained on ImageNet to guess whats in the image you upload.

This website was built with React, Flask, and PyTorch.

## Future Updates:
Apply Transfer learning in order to get more accurate guesses
Possibly turn model to guess images on a specific category rather than a broad amount of categories, ex: Cars or Food.
